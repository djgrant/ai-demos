LocalLLama AI Project Report:
This report highlights new AI projects and tools discussed in the LocalLLama subreddit, along with relevant quotes and thoughts on their fit within emerging AI trends.
General-purpose models:
TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B
"Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation."
This model exemplifies the trend of optimizing LLMs for resource-constrained devices, making them accessible on low-memory hardware like Raspberry Pi.
Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2
"Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux."
Similar to TinyDolphin, this model demonstrates the focus on running LLMs on mobile devices, expanding their reach beyond powerful computers.
Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO
"Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM."
"Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 at Q8_0 ... The best all-round daily task: full 32k contexts, fast, affordable, good foreign language, somewhat uncensored, and good for RAG tasks."
This model highlights the trend of developing versatile LLMs suitable for various tasks, including summarization, translation, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B
"Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM)."
This model represents the push for larger and more powerful LLMs, capable of handling complex tasks and generating high-quality text.
Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO
"Try Mixtral instruct gguf q6, or Miqu EXL2 5.0bpw"
"I can't find anything I like better than Mixtral-Instruct."
This model showcases the trend of exploring multi-model approaches, combining multiple smaller models for improved performance and capabilities.
Roleplay models:
Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B
"Great all around choice. Widely recommended by many users. Punches above what you'd expect."
This model reflects the popularity of LLMs for creative writing and roleplaying, offering engaging and immersive experiences.
Erosumika
"Sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2."
This model demonstrates the desire for LLMs that can generate more natural and organic-sounding dialogue, particularly in creative contexts.
Fimbulvetr-11B-v2
"I haven't tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can't vouch for it, but I hear a lot of great things about it!"
This model indicates the ongoing development of larger and potentially more sophisticated roleplay-focused LLMs.
BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B
"Probably the best RP model I've ever ran since it hits a great balance of prose and intelligence."
This model exemplifies the pursuit of LLMs that excel in both narrative quality and coherence, enhancing the roleplaying experience.
Other models and tools:
Several other models and tools are mentioned in the data, including Westlake-10.7B-v2, Noromaid variants, Midnight-Rose/Midnight-Miqu, Miquliz-120b-v2.0, Blossom V5, and the OpenLLM Leaderboard. These projects showcase various trends in the LLM space, including:
Focus on specific use cases: Models like Westlake and Noromaid variants cater to specific interests, demonstrating the potential for niche LLM applications.
Scaling model size: Models like Miquliz-120b and Goliath 120b push the boundaries of LLM size and capabilities.
Open-source development and benchmarking: Projects like Blossom V5 and the OpenLLM Leaderboard contribute to the open-source LLM ecosystem, fostering collaboration and progress.
Overall, the LocalLLama subreddit offers valuable insights into the dynamic and rapidly evolving world of open-source LLMs. The projects discussed highlight the diverse applications, ongoing advancements, and collaborative spirit within this exciting field.
