## Section 2: AI Project Reports

Here are the reports for each AI project mentioned in Section 1:

### [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1b](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF)

- _"Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation."_
- This model appears to be a general-purpose model that is lightweight and can run on lower-spec devices. It may hallucinate more than other models, but it's a good option for basic conversations.

### [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF)

- _"Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux."_
- This model is another general-purpose model that is slightly larger than TinyDolphin, but can still run on lower-spec devices.

### [Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-imatrix-GGUF)

- _"Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM."_
- This model is a 7B parameter model that is a good balance between performance and memory usage. It's a good option for larger devices.

### [Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF)

- _"Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM)."_
- This model is a larger 10.7B parameter model that requires more memory, but can handle more complex tasks. It's a good option for larger devices with more memory.

### [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF)

- _"At IQ3_S, it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it's slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with)."_
- This model is an 8x7B parameter model that requires more memory, but can handle more complex tasks. It's a good option for larger devices with more memory.

### [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF)

- _"I mostly look for strong character card adherence, system prompt following, response formatting, general coherence and models that will just go along with the most hardcore NSFW roleplay without resistance."_
- This model is a 7B parameter model that is optimized for roleplaying scenarios. It has strong character card adherence, good response formatting, and can handle NSFW scenarios.

### [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF)

- _"I haven't tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can't vouch for it, but I hear a lot of great things about it!"_
- This model is a 11B parameter model that is a good option for larger devices with more memory. It's a good option for complex tasks, but it hasn't been tested as much as other models.

### [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF)

- _No comments_
- This model is an 8x7B parameter model that has not been commented on in the given data.

### [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)

- _"terminal client. I use it for quick Q&A. Automatically offloads GPU layers, easy to download and get a model running, etc. But it lags behind upstream llama.cpp."_
- This project is a terminal client for running AI models that can offload GPU layers. It's easy to use and set up, but may lag behind other clients.

### [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)

- _"terminal client. With cmake, I was able to compile the latest commit (c47cf41) on my 32-bit Android phone."_
- This project is another terminal client for running AI models that can compile on 32-bit Android phones using cmake.

### [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) with [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp)

- _No comments_
- These projects are a frontend and a C++ library for running AI models. They have not been commented on in the given data.
