      "I test models on a wide range of devices, so I have several favorites depending on the size.\n\n## General-purpose models\n- **1.1B:** [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation.\n- **2.7B:** [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF). Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux. \n- **7B:** [Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM.\n- **10.7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF). Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM).\n- **8x7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF). At IQ3_S, it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it's slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with).\n\n## Roleplay models\n- **7B:** [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF) is my most reliable, but I **love** [Erosumika](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Erosumika-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix), which sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2.\n- **10.7B:** [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF). I haven't tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can't vouch for it, but I hear a lot of great things about it!\n- **8x7B:** [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF), probably the best RP model I've ever ran since it hits a great balance of prose and intelligence.\n\nAnd some extra information, while I'm at it:\n\n## Frontends\n- [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama): terminal client. I use it for quick Q&A. Automatically offloads GPU layers, easy to download and get a model running, etc. But it [lags behind upstream llama.cpp](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/1825).\n- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp): terminal client. With cmake, I was able to compile the latest commit (c47cf41) on my 32-bit Android phone.\n- [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) with [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp): For roleplay, or just because of its fancy interface, usually if I'm using a model hosted from another PC, want to do a roleplay, or use its built-in RAG capability (vector storage).\n\n## Settings\n- **General chatting:** Min P at 0.1 (0.01 for 8x7B models), temperature at 1.0.\n- **Roleplaying (7B):** Min P at 0.1 (or 0.05 if the prose is dry), \"Smoothing Factor\" at 0.23, temperature at 2 (as last sampler, not first).\n- **Roleplaying (8x7B):** Min P at 0.001, \"Smoothing Factor\" at 0.23, temperature between 1-1.25 (as last sampler).\n\n**EDIT:** Also, if you're running your models on CPU, or maybe using GPU offloading, it's important to test and see which thread count (for prompt processing and generation) gives you the best results.",
      "Let's be real here, no small amount of attention is paid to this sub by people who are looking for lewd.  I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\n\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\n\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\n\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\n\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.  Even at small quants, IQ2 or IQ3, they write very well, just be a little more patient.  They'll run very well on 2x RTX 3090s.\n\nAnd whatever you do, don't reply with anything else that might arouse, titillate, or seduce someone into taking an imaginary partner or thirty into their own hand.",
      "Midnight-Miqu-103B-v1.0 for creative writing, it's noticeably more intelligent then even the best 70B models.",
      "### Use case:\n\nRoleplay chatting with character cards. Small models.\n\nI mostly look for strong character card adherence, system prompt following, response formatting, general coherence and models that will just go along with the most hardcore NSFW roleplay without resistance.\n\nRecommendations are always welcome.\n\n  - Backend: KoboldCpp (`--contextsize 8192`)\n  - Frontend: SillyTavern\n\n---\n\n### Models:\n\n1) InfinityRP (7B)\n\nAn overall great model with solid character following and great response formatting. Seems to know not to write/speak for the {{user}} and when to stop.\n\n\"This model was basically made to stop some upsetting hallucinations, so {{char}} mostly and occasionally will wait {{user}} response instead of responding itself or deciding for {{user}}, also, my primary idea was to create a cozy model that thinks.\"\n\n  - Model: [Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B](https://huggingface.co/Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n2) BuRP (7B)\n\nSimilar to the above, but with more unalignment. Generally also pretty solid with a slightly different style you might like compared to the original InfinityRP.\n\nThe model card feels like a personal *attack* on my formatting complaints and I can respect that.\n\n\"So you want a model that can do it all? You've been dying to RP with a superintelligence who never refuses your advances while sticking to your strange and oddly specific dialogue format? Well, look no further because BuRP is the model you need.\"\n\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n3) Layris (9B)\n\nThis passthrough Eris merge aimed to bring a high scoring model together with Layla-V4. It has shown to be smart and unaligned. Also a good option in this parameter size for our use case.\n\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B/)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n4) Infinitely-Laydiculous (7B)\n\nI really like InfinityRP's style, and wanted to see it merged with Layla-V4 for her absolute unhingedness/unalignment.\n\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n5) Kunoichi-DPO-v2 (7B)\n\nGreat all around choice. Widely recommended by many users. Punches above what you'd expect.\n\n  - Model: [SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n6) Layla-V4 (7B)\n\nThis model has been stripped out of all refusals. A truly based and unaligned breed that is solid for roleplaying. A NSFW natural.\n\n[I highly recommend you read this post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1b3jj0v)\n\n  - Model: [l3utterfly/mistral-7b-v0.1-layla-v4](https://huggingface.co/l3utterfly/mistral-7b-v0.1-layla-v4/)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/mistral-7b-v0.1-layla-v4-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/mistral-7b-v0.1-layla-v4-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n7) Kunocchini (128k-test) (7B)\n\nKunoichi-DPO-v2 with better handling of longer contexts.\n\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Kunocchini-7b-128k-test](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Kunocchini-7b-128k-test)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Kunocchini-7b-128k-test-GGUF-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Kunocchini-7b-128k-test-GGUF-Imatrix)",
      "I'm obviously partial, but I've been running [wolfram/miquliz-120b-v2.0](https://huggingface.co/wolfram/miquliz-120b-v2.0) almost exclusively since making it. And I just uploaded [additional imatrix GGUF quants](https://huggingface.co/wolfram/miquliz-120b-v2.0-GGUF) today, from IQ1_S to IQ4_XS and in-between (even at 2-bit with IQ2_XS it works great).",
      "Midnight Miqu 70b 1.0/1.5 for rp, switched from Miquliz 120b.\n\nI also tried mistral\\_7b\\_instruct\\_v0.2\\_DARE with mistral-7b-mmproj-v1.5-Q4\\_1 for multimodal this week, it's repeating some stuff but overall it shown better accuracy and less hallucinations in describing images than yi-vl-34b (not sure if yi-vl is just bad or maybe I'm doing something wrong).",
      "**Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 at Q8\\_0**\n\nThe best all-round daily task: full 32k contexts, fast, affordable, good foreign language, somewhat uncensored, and good for RAG tasks.\n\nContext size: 2k is junk, 4k is basic, 8k is decent, 16k is okay, 32k is good.\n\nI work a lot of summarizing and wisdom extraction\\*\\* of long texts around 12k-26k contexts, so 32k contexts is a must. It eats 21+ GB VRAM on my 2x3060.\n\nI'm also wanting Mixtral 8x7B, surely will be much better than Mistral 7B. But I have no idea how many GPUs to run it with 32k contexts, maybe needs 3x3090 cmiiw. So, the little brother still the best for now.\n\n\\*\\*Thanks to [Daniel Miessler](https://github.com/danielmiessler/) for the [yt.py](http://yt.py) script and the special prompt. Amazing!"

You can find the same problem and answer solution verbatim on hundreds of sites at this point. Stop testing models with riddles.",
      "TruthfulQA: 79.84\n\n In my subjective tests, models from Jon Durbin, HF team, NousHermes, Intel and a few other well-known teams/people are the best by far. They also extensively share their graphs, workflows and datasets. Most if not all top scorers don't even share their LoRA hyperparameters. Hell, the top scoring model (smaug) doesn't even have a proper fucking instruct template written anywhere.\n\nLooking at Miqu, Zephyr and Jon's models, they all score slightly above average but they are all better than the rest objectively. I also kind of confirmed this with my experiments. I have a few Mistral models on the board that barely scored better than Zephyr, and I couldn't find a way to increase the scores that much other than cheating.\n\nOh also, again a few of my models scored slightly above average but they are slightly broken! I can't get them to process very long or very short text properly, especially in ChatML template.",
