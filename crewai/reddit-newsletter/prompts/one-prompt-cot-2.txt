Using the data below scraped from the LocalLLama subreddit, write a report with two sections, highlighting all the new AI projects or tools.

Section 1) Pick ALL the projects or tools from the main threads or comments. For each project you'll also need to identify the associated hyperlink to the project. Create a list of these projects in the following format:

```
## [AI Project](link to project)
- {Direct quotes about this project that were stated in the provided data (if there are no quotes, write "no comments")}
- {Thoughts on how it fits within emerging AI trends}
```
  
Here is the data you can use to generate the report:
